Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
This is a repository built using the features offered by WATSON ASSISTANCE,IBM CLOUD FUNCTIONS,WATSON DISCOVERY and NODE RED.It is uploaded in the GITHUB for the completion of SMARTINTERNZ INTERNSHIP PROGRAM.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The chatbots available in general to customers are able to answer simple questions regarding some store details such as locations,timings,directions etc.These are even designed such that they can manage to fix an appointment but at times if the question asked by the customer is outside the scope of the pre-loaded question set ,the chat bot responds to it with a reply of invalid question or offers the customer to speak to a real person.
Here under this project,we have the objective to build a chat bot using WATSON ASSISTANT and enhance it with the ability to access WATSON DISCOVERY collections.In this project, in order to improve the search results we make use of the SMART DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING to build a better model in WATSON DISCOVERY.
The SMART DOCUMENT UNDERSTANDING allows us to train IBM WATSON DISCOVERY to interpret structural elements of complex and diverse documents.It also helps us to rapidly extract new insights in context for deeper understanding , cleaner answers and confident recommendations.
